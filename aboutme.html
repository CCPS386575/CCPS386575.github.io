    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>1.	In my professional life I am working towards getting scholarships for school whether that be through my academics or music. I would like to not have to worry about money when it comes to school as much as possible in my future.  But with all these extracurriculars, in my personal life, I would like to work on trying to set aside time in order to catch up with anything I may need to.
2.	I have always been one to stay focused and on top of things. I think this is a good habit to have especially thinking in terms of a long-term goal. It is best to know what youâ€™re reaching and aiming for. Staying organized and focused can really play an essential part in one's success whether it be short term or long term. Both these characteristics have gotten me far in my academic and music career and they have helped me work towards my goals a ton.
3.	I think stability and organization are necessary for my success. I'm not talking only in the sense of financial stability but emotional stability as well. As for organization, I think it's key for anyone to succeed. No one wants to be around a dysfunctional environment. Being able to work in an environment that works for everyone can help just about anyone focus on what they need to do.
4.	A short-term goal I have in the near future is to have straight A's in quarter 2. I would also like to perform well in my winter concert for orchestra. 
5.	I want to be most known for not giving up easily. I would also like to be known for being reliable and consistent.</p>
